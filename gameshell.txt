    |  Go there, and remove the spider queen (and nothing else).                                                                     |

    |  Note: you have a limited amount of time (20 seconds) to do that. You can use the command ``gsh reset`` to reset the timer.    |
    |                                                                                                                                |

[mission 21] $ man FIND
FIND(1)                                                          General Commands Manual                                                         FIND(1)

NAME
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the
       given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side
       is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is  specified,  `.'  is  as‐
       sumed.

       If  you  are using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by
       other users), you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and comes  with
       findutils.  That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of infor‐
       mation.

OPTIONS
       The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or di‐
       rectories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any  following  arguments
       are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is
       given, the expression -print is used (but you should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately af‐
       ter the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash -- could
       theoretically  be  used  to signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way find determines the
       end of the following path arguments: it does that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if  a  path
       argument  would  start  with  a `-', then find would treat it as expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as
       such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as expression  arguments,  it  is
       generally safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names starting with '/'.  Alternatively, it is
       generally safe though non-portable to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to find.

       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information about files, and the file is a sym‐
              bolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow  symbolic  links.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of
              the file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file  to
              which  the  link points).  Use of this option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is
              in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be
              searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to  rather
              than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing
              (for example -delete) can give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using -L causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do  not  follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When find examines or prints information about files,
              the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this behaviour is when a  file
              specified  on  the  command line is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information used is taken from
              whatever the link points to (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used as  a  fallback  if  the  file
              pointed  to  by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic
              link to a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it  is
       the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect unless either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect how
       those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of tests that compare files listed on the command line against  a  file  we  are
       currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the command line will have been examined and some of its properties will have been
       saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L were  specified),  the  information
       used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the
       link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the
       properties of the link itself will be used.

       When the -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as the argument of -newer will be dereferenced,  and  the  timestamp  will  be
       taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same consideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The  -follow  option has a similar effect to -L, though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow is,
       any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list  of  debug  op‐
              tions should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the debug options is not guaranteed between releases of findutils.  For a complete list
              of valid debug options, see the output of find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints diagnostic information relating to the optimisation of the expression tree; see the -O option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate succeeded or failed.

              search Navigate the directory tree verbosely.

              stat   Print messages as files are examined with the stat and lstat system calls.  The find program tries to minimise such calls.

              tree   Show the expression tree in its original and optimised form.

              all    Enable all of the other debug options (but help).

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables  query  optimisation.   The find program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is, predi‐
              cates with side effects are not reordered relative to each other.  The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to the traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so that tests based
                     only on the names of files (for example -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any -type or -xtype tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files, but before any tests that require  infor‐
                     mation from the inode.  On many modern versions of Unix, file types are returned by readdir() and so these predicates are faster to
                     evaluate than predicates which need to stat the file first.  If you use the -fstype FOO predicate and specify a filesystem type FOO
                     which is not known (that is, present in `/etc/mtab') at the time find starts, that predicate is equivalent to -false.

              3      At  this  optimisation  level,  the full cost-based query optimiser is enabled.  The order of tests is modified so that cheap (i.e.
                     fast) tests are performed first and more expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within each cost band,  predicates  are
                     evaluated  earlier or later according to whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed
                     are evaluated earlier, and for -a, predicates which are likely to fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes account of  the
              specific nature of the test (for example, -type f is assumed to be more likely to succeed than -type c).  The cost-based optimiser is cur‐
              rently  being  evaluated.   If  it does not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed again.  Conversely, optimisations
              that prove to be reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels over time.   However,  the  default  behaviour
              (i.e.  optimisation level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each
              optimisation level and ensures that the result is the same.

EXPRESSION
       The part of the command line after the list of starting points is the expression.  This is a kind of query specification describing how we  match
       files and what we do with the files that were matched.  An expression is composed of a sequence of things:

       Tests  Tests  return  a  true or false value, usually on the basis of some property of a file we are considering.  The -empty test for example is
              true only when the current file is empty.

       Actions
              Actions have side effects (such as printing something on the standard output) and return either true or false, usually based on whether or
              not they are successful.  The -print action for example prints the name of the current file on the standard output.

       Global options
              Global options affect the operation of tests and actions specified on any part of the command line.  Global options  always  return  true.
              The -depth option for example makes find traverse the file system in a depth-first order.

       Positional options
              Positional  options affect only tests or actions which follow them.  Positional options always return true.  The -regextype option for ex‐
              ample is positional, specifying the regular expression dialect for regular expressions occurring later on the command line.

       Operators
              Operators join together the other items within the expression.  They include for example -o (meaning logical OR) and -a  (meaning  logical
              AND).  Where an operator is missing, -a is assumed.

       The -print action is performed on all files for which the whole expression is true, unless it contains an action other than -prune or -quit.  Ac‐
       tions which inhibit the default -print are -delete, -exec, -execdir, -ok, -okdir, -fls, -fprint, -fprintf, -ls, -print and -printf.

       The -delete action also acts like an option (since it implies -depth).

   POSITIONAL OPTIONS
       Positional options always return true.  They affect only tests occurring later on the command line.

       -daystart
              Measure  times  (for -amin, -atime, -cmin, -ctime, -mmin, and -mtime) from the beginning of today rather than from 24 hours ago.  This op‐
              tion only affects tests which appear later on the command line.

       -follow
              Deprecated; use the -L option instead.  Dereference symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.  The -follow option affects only those  tests  which
              appear after it on the command line.  Unless the -H or -L option has been specified, the position of the -follow option changes the behav‐
              iour  of  the -newer predicate; any files listed as the argument of -newer will be dereferenced if they are symbolic links.  The same con‐
              sideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.  Similarly, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a
              symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.  Using -follow causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -regextype type
              Changes the regular expression syntax understood by -regex and -iregex tests which occur later on the command line.  To see which  regular
              expression types are known, use -regextype help.  The Texinfo documentation (see SEE ALSO) explains the meaning of and differences between
              the various types of regular expression.

       -warn, -nowarn
              Turn  warning  messages  on  or off.  These warnings apply only to the command line usage, not to any conditions that find might encounter
              when it searches directories.  The default behaviour corresponds to -warn if standard input is a tty, and  to  -nowarn  otherwise.   If  a
              warning  message  relating to command-line usage is produced, the exit status of find is not affected.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment
              variable is set, and -warn is also used, it is not specified which, if any, warnings will be active.

   GLOBAL OPTIONS
       Global options always return true.  Global options take effect even for tests which occur earlier on the command  line.   To  prevent  confusion,
       global  options should specified on the command-line after the list of start points, just before the first test, positional option or action.  If
       you specify a global option in some other place, find will issue a warning message explaining that this can be confusing.

       The global options occur after the list of start points, and so are not the same kind of option as -L, for example.

       -d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.

       -depth Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.  The -delete action also implies -depth.

       -files0-from file
              Read the starting points from file instead of getting them on the command line.  In contrast to the known limitations of passing  starting
              points  via  arguments  on  the  command line, namely the limitation of the amount of file names, and the inherent ambiguity of file names
              clashing with option names, using this option allows to safely pass an arbitrary number of starting points to find.

              Using this option and passing starting points on the command line is mutually exclusive, and is therefore not allowed at the same time.

              The file argument is mandatory.  One can use -files0-from - to read the list of starting points from the standard input stream,  and  e.g.
              from  a pipe.  In this case, the actions -ok and -okdir are not allowed, because they would obviously interfere with reading from standard
              input in order to get a user confirmation.

              The starting points in file have to be separated by ASCII NUL characters.  Two consecutive NUL characters, i.e., a starting point  with  a
              Zero-length file name is not allowed and will lead to an error diagnostic followed by a non-Zero exit code later.

              In  the  case the given file is empty, find does not process any starting point and therefore will exit immediately after parsing the pro‐
              gram arguments.  This is unlike the standard invocation where find assumes the current directory as starting point if no path argument  is
              passed.

              The  processing  of the starting points is otherwise as usual, e.g.  find will recurse into subdirectories unless otherwise prevented.  To
              process only the starting points, one can additionally pass -maxdepth 0.

              Further notes: if a file is listed more than once in the input file, it is unspecified whether it is visited more than once.  If the  file
              is  mutated during the operation of find, the result is unspecified as well.  Finally, the seek position within the named file at the time
              find exits, be it with -quit or in any other way, is also unspecified.  By "unspecified" here is meant that it may or may not work  or  do
              any specific thing, and that the behavior may change from platform to platform, or from findutils release to release.

       -help, --help
              Print a summary of the command-line usage of find and exit.

       -ignore_readdir_race
              Normally,  find  will  emit an error message when it fails to stat a file.  If you give this option and a file is deleted between the time
              find reads the name of the file from the directory and the time it tries to stat the file, no error message will be issued.  This also ap‐
              plies to files or directories whose names are given on the command line.  This option takes effect at the time the command line  is  read,
              which  means  that you cannot search one part of the filesystem with this option on and part of it with this option off (if you need to do
              that, you will need to issue two find commands instead, one with the option and one without it).

              Furthermore, find with the -ignore_readdir_race option will ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file has disappeared since
              the parent directory was read: it will not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of the -delete action will be true.

       -maxdepth levels
              Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the starting-points.  Using -maxdepth 0 means only  apply  the
              tests and actions to the starting-points themselves.

       -mindepth levels
              Do  not  apply any tests or actions at levels less than levels (a non-negative integer).  Using -mindepth 1 means process all files except
              the starting-points.

       -mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An alternate name for -xdev, for compatibility with some other versions of find.

       -noignore_readdir_race
              Turns off the effect of -ignore_readdir_race.

       -noleaf
              Do not optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer subdirectories than their hard  link  count.   This  option  is  needed  when
              searching  filesystems  that  do  not  follow the Unix directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount
              points.  Each directory on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links: its name and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its  subdirecto‐
              ries (if any) each have a `..' entry linked to that directory.  When find is examining a directory, after it has statted 2 fewer subdirec‐
              tories  than  the  directory's link count, it knows that the rest of the entries in the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the
              directory tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined, there is no need to stat them; this gives a significant increase in search
              speed.

       -version, --version
              Print the find version number and exit.

       -xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

   TESTS
       Some tests, for example -newerXY and -samefile, allow comparison between the file currently being examined and some reference file  specified  on
       the  command line.  When these tests are used, the interpretation of the reference file is determined by the options -H, -L and -P and any previ‐
       ous -follow, but the reference file is only examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If the reference file cannot be examined (for
       example, the stat(2) system call fails for it), an error message is issued, and find exits with a nonzero status.

       A numeric argument n can be specified to tests (like -amin, -mtime, -gid, -inum, -links, -size, -uid and -used) as

       +n     for greater than n,

       -n     for less than n,

       n      for exactly n.

       Supported tests:

       -amin n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n minutes ago.

       -anewer reference
              Time of the last access of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the reference file.  If reference is
              a symbolic link and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it points  to  is
              always used.

       -atime n
              File  was  last  accessed less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file was
              last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have been accessed at least two days ago.

       -cmin n
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly n minutes ago.

       -cnewer reference
              Time of the last status change of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the reference file.  If  ref‐
              erence  is  a  symbolic  link  and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it
              points to is always used.

       -ctime n
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for -atime to understand how rounding af‐
              fects the interpretation of file status change times.

       -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

       -executable
              Matches files which are executable and directories which are searchable (in a file name resolution sense) by the current user.  This takes
              into account access control lists and other permissions artefacts which the -perm test ignores.  This test makes use of the access(2) sys‐
              tem call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many  systems  implement  access(2)  in  the
              client's  kernel  and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held on the server.  Because this test is based only on the result
              of the access(2) system call, there is no guarantee that a file for which this test succeeds can actually be executed.

       -false Always false.

       -fstype type
              File is on a filesystem of type type.  The valid filesystem types vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete list of  filesystem
              types  that are accepted on some version of Unix or another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You can use -printf with the %F
              directive to see the types of your filesystems.

       -gid n File's numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly n.

       -group gname
              File belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed).

       -ilname pattern
              Like -lname, but the match is case insensitive.  If the -L option or the -follow option is in effect, this test returns false  unless  the
              symbolic link is broken.

       -iname pattern
              Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.  For example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match the file names `Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo',
              etc.  The pattern `*foo*` will also match a file called '.foobar'.

       -inum n
              File has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly n.  It is normally easier to use the -samefile test instead.

       -ipath pattern
              Like -path.  but the match is case insensitive.

       -iregex pattern
              Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iwholename pattern
              See -ipath.  This alternative is less portable than -ipath.

       -links n
              File has less than, more than or exactly n hard links.

       -lname pattern
              File  is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern pattern.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially.  If the -L op‐
              tion or the -follow option is in effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.

       -mmin n
              File's data was last modified less than, more than or exactly n minutes ago.

       -mtime n
              File's data was last modified less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for -atime to understand how rounding  af‐
              fects the interpretation of file modification times.

       -name pattern
              Base  of file name (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern pattern.  Because the leading directories are re‐
              moved, the file names considered for a match with -name will never include a slash, so `-name a/b' will never match anything (you probably
              need to use -path instead).  A warning is issued if you try to do this, unless the  environment  variable  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  set.   The
              metacharacters  (`*', `?', and `[]') match a `.' at the start of the base name (this is a change in findutils-4.2.2; see section STANDARDS
              CONFORMANCE below).  To ignore a directory and the files under it, use -prune rather than checking every file in the tree; see an  example
              in  the  description  of  that action.  Braces are not recognised as being special, despite the fact that some shells including Bash imbue
              braces with a special meaning in shell patterns.  The filename matching is performed with the use  of  the  fnmatch(3)  library  function.
              Don't forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it from expansion by the shell.

       -newer reference
              Time  of  the last data modification of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the reference file.  If
              reference is a symbolic link and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the  file  it
              points to is always used.

       -newerXY reference
              Succeeds  if  timestamp X of the file being considered is newer than timestamp Y of the file reference.  The letters X and Y can be any of
              the following letters:

              a   The access time of the file reference
              B   The birth time of the file reference
              c   The inode status change time of reference
              m   The modification time of the file reference
              t   reference is interpreted directly as a time

              Some combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for X to be t.  Some combinations are not implemented on all systems; for  exam‐
              ple B is not supported on all systems.  If an invalid or unsupported combination of XY is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifi‐
              cations  are  interpreted as for the argument to the -d option of GNU date.  If you try to use the birth time of a reference file, and the
              birth time cannot be determined, a fatal error message results.  If you specify a test which refers to the birth time of files being exam‐
              ined, this test will fail for any files where the birth time is unknown.

       -nogroup
              No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

       -nouser
              No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

       -path pattern
              File name matches shell pattern pattern.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for example,
                  find . -path "./sr*sc"
              will print an entry for a directory called ./src/misc (if one exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree, use -prune rather than  checking
              every  file  in the tree.  Note that the pattern match test applies to the whole file name, starting from one of the start points named on
              the command line.  It would only make sense to use an absolute path name here if the relevant start point is also an absolute path.   This
              means that this command will never match anything:
                  find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
              Find  compares the -path argument with the concatenation of a directory name and the base name of the file it's examining.  Since the con‐
              catenation will never end with a slash, -path arguments ending in a slash will match nothing (except perhaps a start  point  specified  on
              the command line).  The predicate -path is also supported by HP-UX find and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.

       -perm mode
              File's  permission bits are exactly mode (octal or symbolic).  Since an exact match is required, if you want to use this form for symbolic
              modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string.  For example `-perm g=w' will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is,
              ones for which group write permission is the only permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to use the `/' or `-' forms,  for
              example `-perm -g=w', which matches any file with group write permission.  See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.

       -perm -mode
              All  of the permission bits mode are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way in which you
              would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative  ex‐
              amples.

       -perm /mode
              Any  of the permission bits mode are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you
              use a symbolic mode.  See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.  If no permission bits in mode are set, this  test  matches
              any file (the idea here is to be consistent with the behaviour of -perm -000).

       -perm +mode
              This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since 2005).  Use -perm /mode instead.

       -readable
              Matches  files which are readable by the current user.  This takes into account access control lists and other permissions artefacts which
              the -perm test ignores.  This test makes use of the access(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do  UID  mapping  (or
              root-squashing),  since many systems implement access(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held
              on the server.

       -regex pattern
              File name matches regular expression pattern.  This is a match on the whole path, not a search.   For  example,  to  match  a  file  named
              ./fubar3, you can use the regular expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'.  The regular expressions understood by find are by de‐
              fault Emacs Regular Expressions (except that `.' matches newline), but this can be changed with the -regextype option.

       -samefile name
              File refers to the same inode as name.  When -L is in effect, this can include symbolic links.

       -size n[cwbkMG]
              File uses less than, more than or exactly n units of space, rounding up.  The following suffixes can be used:

              `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)

              `c'    for bytes

              `w'    for two-byte words

              `k'    for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)

              `M'    for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 bytes)

              `G'    for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1073741824 bytes)

              The  size  is  simply  the  st_size member of the struct stat populated by the lstat (or stat) system call, rounded up as shown above.  In
              other words, it's consistent with the result you get for ls -l.  Bear in mind that the `%k' and `%b' format specifiers of  -printf  handle
              sparse  files  differently.  The `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks and never 1024-byte blocks, which is different to the behaviour
              of -ls.

              The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as usual; i.e., an exact size of n units does not match.  Bear in mind  that  the
              size  is rounded up to the next unit.  Therefore -size -1M is not equivalent to -size -1048576c.  The former only matches empty files, the
              latter matches files from 0 to 1,048,575 bytes.

       -true  Always true.

       -type c
              File is of type c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic link; this is never true if the -L option or the -follow option is in effect, unless the symbolic link is broken.  If  you
                     want to search for symbolic links when -L is in effect, use -xtype.

              s      socket

              D      door (Solaris)

              To search for more than one type at once, you can supply the combined list of type letters separated by a comma `,' (GNU extension).

       -uid n File's numeric user ID is less than, more than or exactly n.

       -used n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n days after its status was last changed.

       -user uname
              File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID allowed).

       -wholename pattern
              See -path.  This alternative is less portable than -path.

       -writable
              Matches  files which are writable by the current user.  This takes into account access control lists and other permissions artefacts which
              the -perm test ignores.  This test makes use of the access(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do  UID  mapping  (or
              root-squashing),  since many systems implement access(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held
              on the server.

       -xtype c
              The same as -type unless the file is a symbolic link.  For symbolic links: if the -H or -P option was specified, true if  the  file  is  a
              link  to  a file of type c; if the -L option has been given, true if c is `l'.  In other words, for symbolic links, -xtype checks the type
              of the file that -type does not check.

       -context pattern
              (SELinux only) Security context of the file matches glob pattern.

   ACTIONS
       -delete
              Delete files or directories; true if removal succeeded.  If the removal failed, an error message is issued and find's exit status will  be
              nonzero (when it eventually exits).

              Warning:  Don't forget that find evaluates the command line as an expression, so putting -delete first will make find try to delete every‐
              thing below the starting points you specified.

              The use of the -delete action on the command line automatically turns on the -depth option.  As in turn -depth makes  -prune  ineffective,
              the -delete action cannot usefully be combined with -prune.

              Often,  the user might want to test a find command line with -print prior to adding -delete for the actual removal run.  To avoid surpris‐
              ing results, it is usually best to remember to use -depth explicitly during those earlier test runs.

              The -delete action will fail to remove a directory unless it is empty.

              Together with the -ignore_readdir_race option, find will ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file  has  disappeared  since
              the  parent  directory  was  read: it will not output an error diagnostic, not change the exit code to nonzero, and the return code of the
              -delete action will be true.

       -exec command ;
              Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until an argument
              consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the  argu‐
              ments  to the command, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both of these constructions might need to be
              escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES section for examples of the use of the -exec
              option.  The specified command is run once for each matched file.  The command is executed in the starting directory.  There are  unavoid‐
              able security problems surrounding use of the -exec action; you should use the -execdir option instead.

       -exec command {} +
              This  variant  of  the  -exec action runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command line is built by appending each se‐
              lected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of the command will be much less than the number of matched files.  The  com‐
              mand line is built in much the same way that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the command, and
              it  must appear at the end, immediately before the `+'; it needs to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect it from interpretation by
              the shell.  The command is executed in the starting directory.  If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit  sta‐
              tus,  then  find returns a non-zero exit status.  If find encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some pending
              commands may not be run at all.  For this reason -exec my-command ... {} + -quit may not result in my-command actually  being  run.   This
              variant of -exec always returns true.

       -execdir command ;

       -execdir command {} +
              Like  -exec,  but  the  specified command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file, which is not normally the directory in
              which you started find.  As with -exec, the {} should be quoted if find is being invoked from a shell.  This a much more secure method for
              invoking commands, as it avoids race conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched files.  As with the -exec  action,  the  `+'
              form of -execdir will build a command line to process more than one matched file, but any given invocation of command will only list files
              that  exist in the same subdirectory.  If you use this option, you must ensure that your PATH environment variable does not reference `.';
              otherwise, an attacker can run any commands they like by leaving an appropriately-named file in a directory in which  you  will  run  -ex‐
              ecdir.   The same applies to having entries in PATH which are empty or which are not absolute directory names.  If any invocation with the
              `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then find returns a non-zero exit status.  If find encounters an error, this  can  some‐
              times cause an immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run at all.  The result of the action depends on whether the + or the ;
              variant is being used; -execdir command {} + always returns true, while -execdir command {} ; returns true only if command returns 0.

       -fls file
              True;  like  -ls  but write to file like -fprint.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the UN‐
              USUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprint file
              True; print the full file name into file file.  If file does not exist when find is run, it is created; if it does exist, it is truncated.
              The file names /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr are handled specially; they refer to the standard output and  standard  error  output,  respec‐
              tively.   The  output  file  is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information
              about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprint0 file
              True; like -print0 but write to file like -fprint.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate is never  matched.   See  the
              UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprintf file format
              True;  like  -printf  but write to file like -fprint.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the
              UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -ls    True; list current file in ls -dils format on standard output.  The block counts are of  1 KB  blocks,  unless  the  environment  variable
              POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual char‐
              acters in filenames are handled.

       -ok command ;
              Like  -exec  but ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run the command.  Otherwise just return false.  If the command is run, its stan‐
              dard input is redirected from /dev/null.  This action may not be specified together with the -files0-from option.

              The response to the prompt is matched against a pair of regular expressions to determine if it is an  affirmative  or  negative  response.
              This  regular  expression is obtained from the system if the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, or otherwise from find's message
              translations.  If the system has no suitable definition, find's own definition will be used.  In either case, the  interpretation  of  the
              regular  expression itself will be affected by the environment variables LC_CTYPE (character classes) and LC_COLLATE (character ranges and
              equivalence classes).

       -okdir command ;
              Like -execdir but ask the user first in the same way as for -ok.  If the user does not agree, just return false.  If the command  is  run,
              its standard input is redirected from /dev/null.  This action may not be specified together with the -files0-from option.

       -print True;  print  the full file name on the standard output, followed by a newline.  If you are piping the output of find into another program
              and there is the faintest possibility that the files which you are searching for might contain a newline, then you should  seriously  con‐
              sider using the -print0 option instead of -print.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in file‐
              names are handled.

       -print0
              True;  print  the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the newline character that -print uses).
              This allows file names that contain newlines or other types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process  the  find
              output.  This option corresponds to the -0 option of xargs.

       -printf format
              True;  print  format on the standard output, interpreting `\' escapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and precisions can be specified as
              with the printf(3) C function.  Please note that many of the fields are printed as %s rather than %d, and this may mean that  flags  don't
              work as you might expect.  This also means that the `-' flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned).  Unlike -print, -printf does
              not add a newline at the end of the string.  The escapes and directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush the output.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \0     ASCII NUL.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

              A `\' character followed by any other character is treated as an ordinary character, so they both are printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's last access time in the format returned by the C ctime(3) function.

              %Ak    File's  last access time in the format specified by k, which is either `@' or a directive for the C strftime(3) function.  The fol‐
                     lowing shows an incomplete list of possible values for k.  Please refer to the documentation of  strftime(3)  for  the  full  list.
                     Some  of the conversion specification characters might not be available on all systems, due to differences in the implementation of
                     the strftime(3) library function.

                     +      Date and time, separated by `+', for example `2004-04-28+22:22:05.0'.  This is a GNU extension.  The time is  given  in  the
                            current  timezone  (which  may be affected by setting the TZ environment variable).  The seconds field includes a fractional
                            part.

                     X      locale's time representation (H:M:S).  The seconds field includes a fractional part.

                     c      locale's date and time (Sat Nov 04 12:02:33 EST 1989).  The format is the same as for ctime(3) and so to  preserve  compati‐
                            bility with that format, there is no fractional part in the seconds field.

                     Y      year (1970...)

              %b     The amount of disk space used for this file in 512-byte blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block
                     size this is usually greater than %s/512, but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %Bk    File's  birth time, i.e., its creation time, in the format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.  This directive produces an
                     empty string if the underlying operating system or filesystem does not support birth times.

              %c     File's last status change time in the format returned by the C ctime(3) function.

              %Ck    File's last status change time in the format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.

              %d     File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file is a starting-point.

              %D     The device number on which the file exists (the st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.

              %f     Print the basename; the file's name with any leading directories removed (only the last element).  For /, the result is  `/'.   See
                     the EXAMPLES section for an example.

              %F     Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can be used for -fstype.

              %g     File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.

              %G     File's numeric group ID.

              %h     Dirname;  the Leading directories of the file's name (all but the last element).  If the file name contains no slashes (since it is
                     in the current directory) the %h specifier expands to `.'.  For files which are themselves directories and contain a slash (includ‐
                     ing /), %h expands to the empty string.  See the EXAMPLES section for an example.

              %H     Starting-point under which file was found.

              %i     File's inode number (in decimal).

              %k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1 KB blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in multiples  of  the  filesystem  block
                     size this is usually greater than %s/1024, but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not a symbolic link).

              %m     File's  permission  bits  (in  octal).  This option uses the `traditional' numbers which most Unix implementations use, but if your
                     particular implementation uses an unusual ordering of octal permissions bits, you will see a difference between the actual value of
                     the file's mode and the output of %m.  Normally you will want to have a leading zero on this number, and to do this, you should use
                     the # flag (as in, for example, `%#m').

              %M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for ls).  This directive is supported in findutils 4.2.5 and later.

              %n     Number of hard links to file.

              %p     File's name.

              %P     File's name with the name of the starting-point under which it was found removed.

              %s     File's size in bytes.

              %S     File's sparseness.  This is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value you will get for an ordinary file of  a
                     certain  length  is  system-dependent.  However, normally sparse files will have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect
                     blocks may have a value which is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of blocks used by a file is file system  dependent.   The
                     value  used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is usually 512 bytes.  If the file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.
                     On systems which lack support for st_blocks, a file's sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.

              %t     File's last modification time in the format returned by the C ctime(3) function.

              %Tk    File's last modification time in the format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.

              %u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name.

              %U     File's numeric user ID.

              %y     File's type (like in ls -l), U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)

              %Y     File's type (like %y), plus follow symbolic links: `L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?' for any other error when determining the type  of
                     the target of a symbolic link.

              %Z     (SELinux only) file's security context.

              %{ %[ %(
                     Reserved for future use.

              A  `%'  character  followed by any other character is discarded, but the other character is printed (don't rely on this, as further format
              characters may be introduced).  A `%' at the end of the format argument causes undefined behaviour since there is no following  character.
              In some locales, it may hide your door keys, while in others it may remove the final page from the novel you are reading.

              The  %m  and  %d directives support the #, 0 and + flags, but the other directives do not, even if they print numbers.  Numeric directives
              that do not support these flags include G, U, b, D, k and n.  The `-' format flag is supported and changes the alignment of a  field  from
              right-justified (which is the default) to left-justified.

              See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -prune True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.  If -depth is given, then -prune has no effect.  Because -delete implies -depth,
              you cannot usefully use -prune and -delete together.  For example, to skip the directory src/emacs and all files and directories under it,
              and print the names of the other files found, do something like this:
                  find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print

       -quit  Exit immediately (with return value zero if no errors have occurred).  This is different to -prune because -prune only applies to the con‐
              tents  of pruned directories, while -quit simply makes find stop immediately.  No child processes will be left running.  Any command lines
              which have been built by -exec ... + or -execdir ... + are invoked before the program is exited.  After -quit is executed, no  more  files
              specified on the command line will be processed.  For example, `find /tmp/foo /tmp/bar -print -quit` will print only `/tmp/foo`.
              One common use of -quit is to stop searching the file system once we have found what we want.  For example, if we want to find just a sin‐
              gle file we can do this:
                  find / -name needle -print -quit

   OPERATORS
       Listed in order of decreasing precedence:

       ( expr )
              Force  precedence.  Since parentheses are special to the shell, you will normally need to quote them.  Many of the examples in this manual
              page use backslashes for this purpose: `\(...\)' instead of `(...)'.

       ! expr True if expr is false.  This character will also usually need protection from interpretation by the shell.

       -not expr
              Same as ! expr, but not POSIX compliant.

       expr1 expr2
              Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an implied -a; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false.

       expr1 -a expr2
              Same as expr1 expr2.

       expr1 -and expr2
              Same as expr1 expr2, but not POSIX compliant.

       expr1 -o expr2
              Or; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is true.

       expr1 -or expr2
              Same as expr1 -o expr2, but not POSIX compliant.

       expr1 , expr2
              List; both expr1 and expr2 are always evaluated.  The value of expr1 is discarded; the value of the list is the value of expr2.  The comma
              operator can be useful for searching for several different types of thing,  but  traversing  the  filesystem  hierarchy  only  once.   The
              -fprintf action can be used to list the various matched items into several different output files.

       Please  note  that  -a when specified implicitly (for example by two tests appearing without an explicit operator between them) or explicitly has
       higher precedence than -o.  This means that find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print will never print afile.

UNUSUAL FILENAMES
       Many of the actions of find result in the printing of data which is under the control of other users.  This includes file names, sizes, modifica‐
       tion times and so forth.  File names are a potential problem since they can contain any character except `\0' and  `/'.   Unusual  characters  in
       file names can do unexpected and often undesirable things to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your function keys on some ter‐
       minals).  Unusual characters are handled differently by various actions, as described below.

       -print0, -fprint0
              Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal.

       -ls, -fls
              Unusual  characters are always escaped.  White space, backslash, and double quote characters are printed using C-style escaping (for exam‐
              ple `\f', `\"').  Other unusual characters are printed using an octal escape.  Other printable characters (for -ls and -fls these are  the
              characters between octal 041 and 0176) are printed as-is.

       -printf, -fprintf
              If  the  output  is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is.  Otherwise, the result depends on which directive is in use.  The direc‐
              tives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are not under control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The  direc‐
              tives  %a,  %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have values which are under the control of files' owners but which cannot be
              used to send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are printed as-is.  The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are quoted.  This quot‐
              ing is performed in the same way as for GNU ls.  This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for -ls and -fls.  If you are able
              to decide what format to use for the output of find then it is normally better to use `\0' as a terminator than to use  newline,  as  file
              names can contain white space and newline characters.  The setting of the LC_CTYPE environment variable is used to determine which charac‐
              ters need to be quoted.

       -print, -fprint
              Quoting  is  handled  in  the same way as for -printf and -fprintf.  If you are using find in a script or in a situation where the matched
              files might have arbitrary names, you should consider using -print0 instead of -print.

       The -ok and -okdir actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.

STANDARDS CONFORMANCE
       For closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.  The following options  are  specified  in
       the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition):

       -H     This option is supported.

       -L     This option is supported.

       -name  This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of the system's fnmatch(3) library function.  As of find‐
              utils-4.2.2,  shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) match a leading `.', because IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.
              This is a change from previous versions of findutils.

       -type  Supported.  POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f' and `s'.  GNU find also supports `D', representing a Door, where the OS  provides
              these.  Furthermore, GNU find allows multiple types to be specified at once in a comma-separated list.

       -ok    Supported.   Interpretation  of  the  response is according to the `yes' and `no' patterns selected by setting the LC_MESSAGES environment
              variable.  When the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, these patterns are taken system's definition of a positive (yes) or nega‐
              tive (no) response.  See the system's documentation for nl_langinfo(3), in particular YESEXPR and NOEXPR.   When  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  not
              set, the patterns are instead taken from find's own message catalogue.

       -newer Supported.   If the file specified is a symbolic link, it is always dereferenced.  This is a change from previous behaviour, which used to
              take the relevant time from the symbolic link; see the HISTORY section below.

       -perm  Supported.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is not set, some mode arguments (for example +a+x) which are not  valid  in  POSIX
              are supported for backward-compatibility.

       Other primaries
              The primaries -atime, -ctime, -depth, -exec, -group, -links, -mtime, -nogroup, -nouser, -ok, -path, -print, -prune, -size, -user and -xdev
              are all supported.

       The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the logical AND/OR operators -a and -o.

       All other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of these extensions are not unique to GNU
       find, however.

       The POSIX standard requires that find detects loops:

              The  find  utility  shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file en‐
              countered.  When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover  its  posi‐
              tion in the hierarchy or terminate.

       GNU find complies with these requirements.  The link count of directories which contain entries which are hard links to an ancestor will often be
       lower than they otherwise should be.  This can mean that GNU find will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a
       link  to  an  ancestor.   Since find does not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a diagnostic message.  Although
       this behaviour may be somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this behaviour.  If  the  leaf  optimisation  has  been
       turned off with -noleaf, the directory entry will always be examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is appropriate.  Symbolic
       links  cannot  be  used to create filesystem cycles as such, but if the -L option or the -follow option is in use, a diagnostic message is issued
       when find encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with loops containing hard links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that find  knows  that
       it doesn't need to call stat() or chdir() on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary.

       The -d option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems, but you should use the POSIX-compliant option -depth instead.

       The POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable does not affect the behaviour of the -regex or -iregex tests because those tests aren't specified in the
       POSIX standard.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LANG   Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null.

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_COLLATE
              The  POSIX  standard  specifies  that  this  variable affects the pattern matching to be used for the -name option.  GNU find uses the fn‐
              match(3) library function, and so support for LC_COLLATE depends on the system library.  This variable also affects the interpretation  of
              the  response  to -ok; while the LC_MESSAGES variable selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to -ok, the interpretation
              of any bracket expressions in the pattern will be affected by LC_COLLATE.

       LC_CTYPE
              This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in regular expressions and also with the -name test,  if  the  system's  fn‐
              match(3)  library  function  supports this.  This variable also affects the interpretation of any character classes in the regular expres‐
              sions used to interpret the response to the prompt issued by -ok.  The LC_CTYPE environment variable will also affect which characters are
              considered to be unprintable when filenames are printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determines the locale to be used for internationalised messages.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, this also determines
              the interpretation of the response to the prompt made by the -ok action.

       NLSPATH
              Determines the location of the internationalisation message catalogues.

       PATH   Affects the directories which are searched to find the executables invoked by -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              Determines the block size used by -ls and -fls.  If POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, blocks are units of 512 bytes.  Otherwise they  are  units  of
              1024 bytes.

              Setting  this  variable  also turns off warning messages (that is, implies -nowarn) by default, because POSIX requires that apart from the
              output for -ok, all messages printed on stderr are diagnostics and must result in a non-zero exit status.

              When POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set, -perm +zzz is treated just like -perm /zzz if +zzz is not a valid symbolic mode.  When POSIXLY_CORRECT is
              set, such constructs are treated as an error.

              When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, the response to the prompt made by the -ok action is interpreted according to the system's message catalogue,
              as opposed to according to find's own message translations.

       TZ     Affects the time zone used for some of the time-related format directives of -printf and -fprintf.

EXAMPLES
   Simple `find|xargs` approach
       •      Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them.

                  $ find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f

              Note that this will work incorrectly if there are any filenames containing newlines, single or double quotes, or spaces.

   Safer `find -print0 | xargs -0` approach
       •      Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them, processing filenames in such a way that file or directory names con‐
              taining single or double quotes, spaces or newlines are correctly handled.

                  $ find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f

              The -name test comes before the -type test in order to avoid having to call stat(2) on every file.

       Note that there is still a race between the time find traverses the hierarchy printing the matching filenames, and the time the process  executed
       by xargs works with that file.

   Processing arbitrary starting points
       •      Given  that  another program proggy pre-filters and creates a huge NUL-separated list of files, process those as starting points, and find
              all regular, empty files among them:

                  $ proggy | find -files0-from - -maxdepth 0 -type f -empty

              The use of `-files0-from -` means to read the names of the starting points from standard input, i.e., from the pipe; and  -maxdepth 0  en‐
              sures that only explicitly those entries are examined without recursing into directories (in the case one of the starting points is one).

   Executing a command for each file
       •      Run file on every file in or below the current directory.

                  $ find . -type f -exec file '{}' \;

              Notice  that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation.  The semicolon
              is similarly protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes could have been used in that case also.

       In many cases, one might prefer the `-exec ... +` or better the `-execdir ... +` syntax for performance and security reasons.

   Traversing the filesystem just once - for 2 different actions
       •      Traverse the filesystem just once, listing set-user-ID files and directories into /root/suid.txt and large files into /root/big.txt.

                  $ find / \
                      \( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt '%#m %u %p\n' \) , \
                      \( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt '%-10s %p\n' \)

              This example uses the line-continuation character '\' on the first two lines to instruct the shell to continue reading the command on  the
              next line.

   Searching files by age
       •      Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours.

                  $ find $HOME -mtime 0

              This  command  works  this  way  because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any remainder is discarded.
              That means that to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a modification in the past which is less than 24 hours ago.

   Searching files by permissions
       •      Search for files which are executable but not readable.

                  $ find /sbin /usr/sbin -executable \! -readable -print

       •      Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner, and group, but which other users can read but not write to.

                  $ find . -perm 664

              Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example if someone can execute the file) will not be matched.

       •      Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner and group, and which other users can read,  without  regard  to  the
              presence of any extra permission bits (for example the executable bit).

                  $ find . -perm -664

              This will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.

       •      Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).

                  $ find . -perm /222

       •      Search for files which are writable by either their owner or their group.

                  $ find . -perm /220
                  $ find . -perm /u+w,g+w
                  $ find . -perm /u=w,g=w

              All three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses the octal representation of the file mode, and the other two use the
              symbolic form.  The files don't have to be writable by both the owner and group to be matched; either will do.

       •      Search for files which are writable by both their owner and their group.

                  $ find . -perm -220
                  $ find . -perm -g+w,u+w

              Both these commands do the same thing.

       •      A more elaborate search on permissions.

                  $ find . -perm -444 -perm /222 \! -perm /111
                  $ find . -perm -a+r -perm /a+w \! -perm /a+x

              These  two  commands  both  search  for  files that are readable for everybody (-perm -444 or -perm -a+r), have at least one write bit set
              (-perm /222 or -perm /a+w) but are not executable for anybody (! -perm /111 or ! -perm /a+x respectively).

   Pruning - omitting files and subdirectories
       •      Copy the contents of /source-dir to /dest-dir, but omit files and directories named .snapshot (and anything in them).  It also omits files
              or directories whose name ends in `~', but not their contents.

                  $ cd /source-dir
                  $ find . -name .snapshot -prune -o \( \! -name '*~' -print0 \) \
                      | cpio -pmd0 /dest-dir

              The construct -prune -o \( ... -print0 \) is quite common.  The idea here is that the expression before -prune matches things which are to
              be pruned.  However, the -prune action itself returns true, so the following -o ensures that the right hand side  is  evaluated  only  for
              those directories which didn't get pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are not even visited, so their contents are irrelevant).
              The  expression  on  the  right hand side of the -o is in parentheses only for clarity.  It emphasises that the -print0 action takes place
              only for things that didn't have -prune applied to them.  Because the default `and' condition between tests binds more  tightly  than  -o,
              this is the default anyway, but the parentheses help to show what is going on.

       •      Given  the  following  directory  of  projects  and  their  associated SCM administrative directories, perform an efficient search for the
              projects' roots:

                  $ find repo/ \
                      \( -exec test -d '{}/.svn' \; \
                      -or -exec test -d '{}/.git' \; \
                      -or -exec test -d '{}/CVS' \; \
                      \) -print -prune

              Sample output:

                  repo/project1/CVS
                  repo/gnu/project2/.svn
                  repo/gnu/project3/.svn
                  repo/gnu/project3/src/.svn
                  repo/project4/.git

              In this example, -prune prevents unnecessary descent into directories that have already been discovered (for  example  we  do  not  search
              project3/src because we already found project3/.svn), but ensures sibling directories (project2 and project3) are found.

   Other useful examples
       •      Search for several file types.

                  $ find /tmp -type f,d,l

              Search  for  files,  directories,  and symbolic links in the directory /tmp passing these types as a comma-separated list (GNU extension),
              which is otherwise equivalent to the longer, yet more portable:

                  $ find /tmp \( -type f -o -type d -o -type l \)

       •      Search for files with the particular name needle and stop immediately when we find the first one.

                  $ find / -name needle -print -quit

       •      Demonstrate the interpretation of the %f and %h format directives of the -printf action for some corner-cases.  Here is an example includ‐
              ing some output.

                  $ find . .. / /tmp /tmp/TRACE compile compile/64/tests/find -maxdepth 0 -printf '[%h][%f]\n'
                  [.][.]
                  [.][..]
                  [][/]
                  [][tmp]
                  [/tmp][TRACE]
                  [.][compile]
                  [compile/64/tests][find]

EXIT STATUS
       find exits with status 0 if all files are processed successfully, greater than 0 if errors occur.  This is deliberately a very broad description,
       but if the return value is non-zero, you should not rely on the correctness of the results of find.

       When some error occurs, find may stop immediately, without completing all the actions specified.  For example, some starting points may not  have
       been examined or some pending program invocations for -exec ... {} + or -execdir ... {} + may not have been performed.

HISTORY
       As  of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) used in filename patterns match a leading `.', because IEEE POSIX in‐
       terpretation 126 requires this.

       As of findutils-4.3.3, -perm /000 now matches all files instead of none.

       Nanosecond-resolution timestamps were implemented in findutils-4.3.3.

       As of findutils-4.3.11, the -delete action sets find's exit status to a nonzero value when it fails.  However, find will  not  exit  immediately.
       Previously, find's exit status was unaffected by the failure of -delete.

NON-BUGS
   Operator precedence surprises
       The command find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print will never print afile because this is actually equivalent to find . -name afile -o \( -name
       bfile -a -print \).  Remember that the precedence of -a is higher than that of -o and when there is no operator specified between  tests,  -a  is
       assumed.

   “paths must precede expression” error message
       $ find . -name *.c -print
       find: paths must precede expression
       find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?

       This  happens when the shell could expand the pattern *.c to more than one file name existing in the current directory, and passing the resulting
       file names in the command line to find like this:
       find . -name frcode.c locate.c word_io.c -print
       That command is of course not going to work, because the -name predicate allows exactly only one pattern as argument.  Instead  of  doing  things
       this  way,  you  should  enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard, thus allowing find to use the pattern with the wildcard during the
       search for file name matching instead of file names expanded by the parent shell:
       $ find . -name '*.c' -print
       $ find . -name \*.c -print

BUGS
       There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard specifies for find, which therefore cannot be fixed.  For  example,
       the -exec action is inherently insecure, and -execdir should be used instead.

       The environment variable LC_COLLATE has no effect on the -ok action.

FIND(1)                                                          General Commands Manual                                                         FIND(1)

NAME
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the
       given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side
       is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is  specified,  `.'  is  as‐
       sumed.

       If  you  are using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by
       other users), you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and comes  with
       findutils.  That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of infor‐
       mation.

OPTIONS
       The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or di‐
       rectories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any  following  arguments
       are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is
       given, the expression -print is used (but you should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately af‐
       ter the last path name.  The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash -- could
       theoretically  be  used  to signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way find determines the
       end of the following path arguments: it does that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if  a  path
       argument  would  start  with  a `-', then find would treat it as expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as
       such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as expression  arguments,  it  is
       generally safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names starting with '/'.  Alternatively, it is
       generally safe though non-portable to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass arbitrary starting points to find.

       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information about files, and the file is a sym‐
              bolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow  symbolic  links.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of
              the file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file  to
              which  the  link points).  Use of this option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is
              in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be
              searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to  rather
              than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing
              (for example -delete) can give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using -L causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do  not  follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When find examines or prints information about files,
              the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this behaviour is when a  file
              specified  on  the  command line is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information used is taken from
              whatever the link points to (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used as  a  fallback  if  the  file
              pointed  to  by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic
              link to a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If more than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it  is
       the default, the -P option should be considered to be in effect unless either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU  find frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect how
       those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of tests that compare files listed on the command line against  a  file  we  are
       currently  considering.   In  each case, the file specified on the command line will have been examined and some of its properties will have been
       saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L were  specified),  the  information
       used  for the comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the
       link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the
       properties of the link itself will be used.

       When the -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as the argument of -newer will be dereferenced,  and  the  timestamp  will  be
       taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same consideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The  -follow  option has a similar effect to -L, though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow is,
       any symbolic links appearing after -follow on the command line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       | A forgetful old hermit called Servillus has set up camp in a cave with his old, leather-bound potion book.                    |
       | Go to the cave and help him remember the recipe of his famous herbal tea.                                                     |

       | In order to validate the mission, you need to be in the cave with Servillus **and** your last command prior to ``gsh check``  |

       | Many of Unix commands process text: they receive text as input and produce text as output.                                     |.
       |                                                                                                                                |.
       | It is common for those commands to write their output to their "standard output", which means that (by default) the output is  |.
       | written into the terminal.                                                                                                     |.
       |                                                                                                                                |.
       | Most of those commands can receive input either through files (given as arguments) or from their "standard input". For         |.
       | example:                                                                                                                       |.
       | - ``head FILE`` reads its input from the file,                                                                                 |.
       | - ``head`` reads its input on the standard input.                                                                              |.
       |                                                                                                                                |.
       | By default, data from the standard input is read from the keyboard, but a pipe can change that.                                |.

       | Many of Unix commands process text: they receive text as input and produce text as output.                                     |
       |                                                                                                                                |
       | It is common for those commands to write their output to their "standard output", which means that (by default) the output is  |
       | written into the terminal.                                                                                                     |
       |                                                                                                                                |
       | Most of those commands can receive input either through files (given as arguments) or from their "standard input". For         |
       | example:                                                                                                                       |
       | - ``head FILE`` reads its input from the file,                                                                                 |
       | - ``head`` reads its input on the standard input.                                                                              |
       |                                                                                                                                |
       | By default, data from the standard input is read from the keyboard, but a pipe can change that.                                |

SYNOPSIS
       head [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --bytes=[-]NUM
              print the first NUM bytes of each file; with the leading '-', print all but the last NUM bytes of each file

       -n, --lines=[-]NUM
              print the first NUM lines instead of the first 10; with the leading '-', print all but the last NUM lines of each file

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never print headers giving file names

       -v, --verbose
              always print headers giving file names

       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

|       |   Merlin's old alchemy books are kept in his office, in the library. You need to output a list of all the books containing the    |       |
|       |   alchemical compound 'gsh' (for "Glutathione").                                                                                  |       |

|       |   Merlin has turned crazy... He paces around the observatory tower and mumbles incoherently.    |       |
|       |                                                                                                 |       |
|       |   You need to filter out his ramblings to discover the secret key he is the only one to know.   |       |
|       |                                                                                                 |       |

|       |   It is likely that Merlin's message is riddled with errors.                                    |       |

FIND(1)                                                                 General Commands Manual                                                                FIND(1)

NAME
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expres‐
       sion from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for  and  opera‐
       tions, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users),
       you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and comes with  findutils.   That  document
       also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OPTIONS
       The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be
       examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the  expression
       describing  what  is  to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression -print is used (but
       you should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately  after  the  last
       path  name.   The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash -- could theoretically be used to
       signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way find determines the end of the following path  arguments:  it
       does  that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would treat
       it as expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded  by  the
       calling  shell  are  not mistakenly treated as expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use
       absolute path names starting with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass  arbitrary  starting
       points to find.

       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information about files, and the file is a symbolic link, the
              information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expres‐
       sion from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for  and  opera‐
       tions, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users),
       you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and comes with  findutils.   That  document
       also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OPTIONS
       The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be
       examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the  expression
       describing  what  is  to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression -print is used (but
       you should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately  after  the  last
       path  name.   The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash -- could theoretically be used to
       signal that any remaining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way find determines the end of the following path  arguments:  it
       does  that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a `-').  Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then find would treat
       it as expression argument instead.  Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns expanded  by  the
       calling  shell  are  not mistakenly treated as expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use
       absolute path names starting with '/'.  Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable to use the GNU option -files0-from to pass  arbitrary  starting
       points to find.

       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information about files, and the file is a symbolic link, the
              information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow  symbolic  links.   When  find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the file to
              which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file to which  the  link  points).
              Use  of this option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is in effect and find discovers a symbolic
              link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the  link
              itself  (unless  the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing (for example -delete) can
              give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using -L causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information
              used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.  The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the command  line
              is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information used is taken from whatever the link points to (that is, the link
              is  followed).  The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If -H is in
              effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined (though  of
              course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If  more  than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it is the default,
       the -P option should be considered to be in effect unless either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU find frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect  how  those  argu‐
       ments  are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we are currently considering.  In
       each case, the file specified on the command line will have been examined and some of its properties will have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a sym‐
       bolic link, and the -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L were specified), the information used for the comparison will be taken from the  properties
       of  the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the link points to.  If find cannot follow the link (for example because it
       has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When the -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will  be  taken  from  the
       file to which the symbolic link points.  The same consideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and -cnewer.

       The  -follow  option  has a similar effect to -L, though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that is, if -L is not used but -follow is, any symbolic
       links appearing after -follow on the command line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why find is not doing what you want.  The list of debug  options  should  be
              comma  separated.   Compatibility of the debug options is not guaranteed between releases of findutils.  For a complete list of valid debug options, see
              the output of find -D help.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints diagnostic information relating to the optimisation of the expression tree; see the -O option.

              rates  Prints a summary indicating how often each predicate succeeded or failed.

              search Navigate the directory tree verbosely.

              stat   Print messages as files are examined with the stat and lstat system calls.  The find program tries to minimise such calls.

              tree   Show the expression tree in its original and optimised form.

              all    Enable all of the other debug options (but help).

              help   Explain the debugging options.

       -Olevel
              Enables query optimisation.  The find program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is,  predicates  with  side
              effects are not reordered relative to each other.  The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This  is  the default optimisation level and corresponds to the traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so that tests based only on the
                     names of files (for example -name and -regex) are performed first.

              2      Any -type or -xtype tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files, but before any tests that require information from  the
                     inode.   On  many  modern  versions  of Unix, file types are returned by readdir() and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than predicates
                     which need to stat the file first.  If you use the -fstype FOO predicate and specify a filesystem type FOO which is not known (that  is,  present
                     in `/etc/mtab') at the time find starts, that predicate is equivalent to -false.

              3      At  this  optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimiser is enabled.  The order of tests is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are
                     performed first and more expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later  ac‐
                     cording  to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For -o, predicates which are likely to succeed are evaluated earlier, and for -a, predi‐
                     cates which are likely to fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes account of the  specific  na‐
              ture  of  the  test (for example, -type f is assumed to be more likely to succeed than -type c).  The cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.
              If it does not actually improve the performance of find, it will be removed again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, robust and  ef‐
              fective  may  be  enabled at lower optimisation levels over time.  However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed in the
              4.3.x release series.  The findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is the same.

EXPRESSION
       The part of the command line after the list of starting points is the expression.  This is a kind of query specification describing how we match files and what
       we do with the files that were matched.  An expression is composed of a sequence of things:

       Tests  Tests return a true or false value, usually on the basis of some property of a file we are considering.  The -empty test for example is true  only  when
              the current file is empty.

       Actions
              Actions  have side effects (such as printing something on the standard output) and return either true or false, usually based on whether or not they are
              successful.  The -print action for example prints the name of the current file on the standard output.

       Global options
              Global options affect the operation of tests and actions specified on any part of the command line.  Global options always return true.  The -depth  op‐
              tion for example makes find traverse the file system in a depth-first order.

       Positional options
              Positional  options  affect only tests or actions which follow them.  Positional options always return true.  The -regextype option for example is posi‐
              tional, specifying the regular expression dialect for regular expressions occurring later on the command line.

       Operators
              Operators join together the other items within the expression.  They include for example -o (meaning logical OR) and -a (meaning logical AND).  Where an
              operator is missing, -a is assumed.

       The -print action is performed on all files for which the whole expression is true, unless it contains an action other than -prune or -quit.  Actions which in‐
       hibit the default -print are -delete, -exec, -execdir, -ok, -okdir, -fls, -fprint, -fprintf, -ls, -print and -printf.

       The -delete action also acts like an option (since it implies -depth).

   POSITIONAL OPTIONS
       Positional options always return true.  They affect only tests occurring later on the command line.

       -daystart
              Measure times (for -amin, -atime, -cmin, -ctime, -mmin, and -mtime) from the beginning of today rather than from 24 hours ago.  This option only affects
              tests which appear later on the command line.

       -follow
              Deprecated; use the -L option instead.  Dereference symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.  The -follow option affects only those tests which appear after it
              on the command line.  Unless the -H or -L option has been specified, the position of the -follow option changes the behaviour of the  -newer  predicate;
              any  files  listed  as  the argument of -newer will be dereferenced if they are symbolic links.  The same consideration applies to -newerXY, -anewer and
              -cnewer.  Similarly, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.  Us‐
              ing -follow causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -regextype type
              Changes the regular expression syntax understood by -regex and -iregex tests which occur later on the command line.  To  see  which  regular  expression
              types  are  known,  use  -regextype help.  The Texinfo documentation (see SEE ALSO) explains the meaning of and differences between the various types of
              regular expression.

       -warn, -nowarn
              Turn warning messages on or off.  These warnings apply only to the command line usage, not to any conditions that find might encounter when it  searches
              directories.   The  default  behaviour corresponds to -warn if standard input is a tty, and to -nowarn otherwise.  If a warning message relating to com‐
              mand-line usage is produced, the exit status of find is not affected.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, and -warn is also used, it is
              not specified which, if any, warnings will be active.

   GLOBAL OPTIONS
       Global options always return true.  Global options take effect even for tests which occur earlier on the command line.  To prevent  confusion,  global  options
       should  specified  on the command-line after the list of start points, just before the first test, positional option or action.  If you specify a global option
       in some other place, find will issue a warning message explaining that this can be confusing.

       The global options occur after the list of start points, and so are not the same kind of option as -L, for example.

       -d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.

       -depth Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.  The -delete action also implies -depth.

       -files0-from file
              Read the starting points from file instead of getting them on the command line.  In contrast to the known limitations of passing starting points via ar‐
              guments on the command line, namely the limitation of the amount of file names, and the inherent ambiguity of file names clashing with option names, us‐
              ing this option allows to safely pass an arbitrary number of starting points to find.

              Using this option and passing starting points on the command line is mutually exclusive, and is therefore not allowed at the same time.

              The file argument is mandatory.  One can use -files0-from - to read the list of starting points from the standard input stream, and e.g.  from  a  pipe.
              In this case, the actions -ok and -okdir are not allowed, because they would obviously interfere with reading from standard input in order to get a user
              confirmation.

              The  starting  points  in  file have to be separated by ASCII NUL characters.  Two consecutive NUL characters, i.e., a starting point with a Zero-length
              file name is not allowed and will lead to an error diagnostic followed by a non-Zero exit code later.

              In the case the given file is empty, find does not process any starting point and therefore will exit immediately after parsing the  program  arguments.
              This is unlike the standard invocation where find assumes the current directory as starting point if no path argument is passed.

              The  processing  of  the starting points is otherwise as usual, e.g.  find will recurse into subdirectories unless otherwise prevented.  To process only
              the starting points, one can additionally pass -maxdepth 0.

              Further notes: if a file is listed more than once in the input file, it is unspecified whether it is visited more than once.  If  the  file  is  mutated
              during  the  operation  of find, the result is unspecified as well.  Finally, the seek position within the named file at the time find exits, be it with
              -quit or in any other way, is also unspecified.  By "unspecified" here is meant that it may or may not work or do any specific thing, and that  the  be‐
              havior may change from platform to platform, or from findutils release to release.

       -help, --help
              Print a summary of the command-line usage of find and exit.

       -ignore_readdir_race
              Normally,  find  will emit an error message when it fails to stat a file.  If you give this option and a file is deleted between the time find reads the
              name of the file from the directory and the time it tries to stat the file, no error message will be issued.  This also applies to files or  directories
              whose  names  are given on the command line.  This option takes effect at the time the command line is read, which means that you cannot search one part
              of the filesystem with this option on and part of it with this option off (if you need to do that, you will need to issue two find commands instead, one
              with the option and one without it).

              Furthermore, find with the -ignore_readdir_race option will ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file has disappeared  since  the  parent
              directory was read: it will not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of the -delete action will be true.

       -maxdepth levels
              Descend  at  most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the starting-points.  Using -maxdepth 0 means only apply the tests and ac‐
              tions to the starting-points themselves.

       -mindepth levels
              Do not apply any tests or actions at levels less than levels (a non-negative integer).  Using -mindepth 1 means process all files except  the  starting-
              points.

       -mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An alternate name for -xdev, for compatibility with some other versions of find.

       -noignore_readdir_race
              Turns off the effect of -ignore_readdir_race.

       -noleaf
              Do  not  optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer subdirectories than their hard link count.  This option is needed when searching filesys‐
              tems that do not follow the Unix directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points.  Each directory on a normal
              Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links: its name and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its subdirectories (if any) each have a `..' entry linked to  that
              directory.   When  find is examining a directory, after it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's link count, it knows that the rest of
              the entries in the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the directory tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined, there is  no  need
              to stat them; this gives a significant increase in search speed.

       -version, --version
              Print the find version number and exit.

       -xdev  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

   TESTS
       Some  tests,  for  example  -newerXY and -samefile, allow comparison between the file currently being examined and some reference file specified on the command
       line.  When these tests are used, the interpretation of the reference file is determined by the options -H, -L and -P and any previous -follow, but the  refer‐
       ence  file is only examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If the reference file cannot be examined (for example, the stat(2) system call fails
       for it), an error message is issued, and find exits with a nonzero status.

       A numeric argument n can be specified to tests (like -amin, -mtime, -gid, -inum, -links, -size, -uid and -used) as

       +n     for greater than n,

       -n     for less than n,

       n      for exactly n.

       Supported tests:

       -amin n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n minutes ago.

       -anewer reference
              Time of the last access of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the reference file.  If reference  is  a  symbolic
              link and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -atime n
              File  was  last accessed less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file was last accessed,
              any fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have been accessed at least two days ago.

       -cmin n
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly n minutes ago.

       -cnewer reference
              Time of the last status change of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the reference file.  If reference is a sym‐
              bolic link and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -ctime n
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for -atime to understand how rounding affects  the  in‐
              terpretation of file status change times.

       -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

       -executable
              Matches  files which are executable and directories which are searchable (in a file name resolution sense) by the current user.  This takes into account
              access control lists and other permissions artefacts which the -perm test ignores.  This test makes use of the access(2) system  call,  and  so  can  be
              fooled  by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems implement access(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of
              the UID mapping information held on the server.  Because this test is based only on the result of the access(2) system call, there is no guarantee  that
              a file for which this test succeeds can actually be executed.

       -false Always false.

       -fstype type
              File is on a filesystem of type type.  The valid filesystem types vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete list of filesystem types that are
              accepted on some version of Unix or another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.  You can use -printf with the %F directive to see the types of
              your filesystems.

       -gid n File's numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly n.

       -group gname
              File belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed).

       -ilname pattern
              Like  -lname,  but the match is case insensitive.  If the -L option or the -follow option is in effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link
              is broken.

       -iname pattern
              Like -name, but the match is case insensitive.  For example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match the file names `Foo', `FOO',  `foo',  `fOo',  etc.   The
              pattern `*foo*` will also match a file called '.foobar'.

       -inum n
              File has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly n.  It is normally easier to use the -samefile test instead.

       -ipath pattern
              Like -path.  but the match is case insensitive.

       -iregex pattern
              Like -regex, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iwholename pattern
              See -ipath.  This alternative is less portable than -ipath.

       -links n
              File has less than, more than or exactly n hard links.

       -lname pattern
              File  is  a  symbolic  link  whose contents match shell pattern pattern.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially.  If the -L option or the
              -follow option is in effect, this test returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.

       -mmin n
              File's data was last modified less than, more than or exactly n minutes ago.

       -mtime n
              File's data was last modified less than, more than or exactly n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for -atime to understand how rounding affects the inter‐
              pretation of file modification times.

       -name pattern
              Base of file name (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern pattern.  Because the leading directories are removed, the  file
              names  considered  for a match with -name will never include a slash, so `-name a/b' will never match anything (you probably need to use -path instead).
              A warning is issued if you try to do this, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  The metacharacters (`*', `?', and `[]') match a  `.'
              at the start of the base name (this is a change in findutils-4.2.2; see section STANDARDS CONFORMANCE below).  To ignore a directory and the files under
              it,  use  -prune rather than checking every file in the tree; see an example in the description of that action.  Braces are not recognised as being spe‐
              cial, despite the fact that some shells including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning in shell patterns.  The filename matching is  performed  with
              the use of the fnmatch(3) library function.  Don't forget to enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it from expansion by the shell.

       -newer reference
              Time  of the last data modification of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the reference file.  If reference is a
              symbolic link and the -H option or the -L option is in effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -newerXY reference
              Succeeds if timestamp X of the file being considered is newer than timestamp Y of the file reference.  The letters X and Y can be any of  the  following
              letters:

              a   The access time of the file reference
              B   The birth time of the file reference
              c   The inode status change time of reference
              m   The modification time of the file reference
              t   reference is interpreted directly as a time

              Some  combinations  are  invalid;  for example, it is invalid for X to be t.  Some combinations are not implemented on all systems; for example B is not
              supported on all systems.  If an invalid or unsupported combination of XY is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are  interpreted  as
              for  the  argument to the -d option of GNU date.  If you try to use the birth time of a reference file, and the birth time cannot be determined, a fatal
              error message results.  If you specify a test which refers to the birth time of files being examined, this test will fail for any files where the  birth
              time is unknown.

       -nogroup
              No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

       -nouser
              No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

       -path pattern
              File name matches shell pattern pattern.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for example,
                  find . -path "./sr*sc"
              will  print an entry for a directory called ./src/misc (if one exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree, use -prune rather than checking every file in
              the tree.  Note that the pattern match test applies to the whole file name, starting from one of the start points named on the command line.   It  would
              only  make  sense to use an absolute path name here if the relevant start point is also an absolute path.  This means that this command will never match
              anything:
                  find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
              Find compares the -path argument with the concatenation of a directory name and the base name of the file it's examining.  Since the concatenation  will
              never  end  with a slash, -path arguments ending in a slash will match nothing (except perhaps a start point specified on the command line).  The predi‐
              cate -path is also supported by HP-UX find and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.

       -perm mode
              File's permission bits are exactly mode (octal or symbolic).  Since an exact match is required, if you want to use this form for symbolic modes, you may
              have to specify a rather complex mode string.  For example `-perm g=w' will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which  group  write
              permission  is  the only permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to use the `/' or `-' forms, for example `-perm -g=w', which matches any
              file with group write permission.  See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.

       -perm -mode
              All of the permission bits mode are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way in which you would want  to
              use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.

       -perm /mode
              Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic
              mode.   See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples.  If no permission bits in mode are set, this test matches any file (the idea here is to
              be consistent with the behaviour of -perm -000).

       -perm +mode
              This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since 2005).  Use -perm /mode instead.

       -readable
              Matches files which are readable by the current user.  This takes into account access control lists and other permissions artefacts which the -perm test
              ignores.  This test makes use of the access(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping  (or  root-squashing),  since  many
              systems implement access(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held on the server.

       -regex pattern
              File  name  matches  regular expression pattern.  This is a match on the whole path, not a search.  For example, to match a file named ./fubar3, you can
              use the regular expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3', but not `f.*r3'.  The regular expressions understood by find are by default Emacs  Regular  Expressions
              (except that `.' matches newline), but this can be changed with the -regextype option.

       -samefile name
              File refers to the same inode as name.  When -L is in effect, this can include symbolic links.

       -size n[cwbkMG]
              File uses less than, more than or exactly n units of space, rounding up.  The following suffixes can be used:

              `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)

              `c'    for bytes

              `w'    for two-byte words

              `k'    for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)

              `M'    for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 bytes)

              `G'    for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1073741824 bytes)

              The  size is simply the st_size member of the struct stat populated by the lstat (or stat) system call, rounded up as shown above.  In other words, it's
              consistent with the result you get for ls -l.  Bear in mind that the `%k' and `%b' format specifiers of -printf handle sparse  files  differently.   The
              `b' suffix always denotes 512-byte blocks and never 1024-byte blocks, which is different to the behaviour of -ls.

              The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as usual; i.e., an exact size of n units does not match.  Bear in mind that the size is rounded
              up to the next unit.  Therefore -size -1M is not equivalent to -size -1048576c.  The former only matches empty files, the latter matches files from 0 to
              1,048,575 bytes.

       -true  Always true.

       -type c
              File is of type c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic link; this is never true if the -L option or the -follow option is in effect, unless the symbolic link is broken.  If you want to search
                     for symbolic links when -L is in effect, use -xtype.

              s      socket

              D      door (Solaris)

              To search for more than one type at once, you can supply the combined list of type letters separated by a comma `,' (GNU extension).

       -uid n File's numeric user ID is less than, more than or exactly n.

       -used n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly n days after its status was last changed.

       -user uname
              File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID allowed).

       -wholename pattern
              See -path.  This alternative is less portable than -path.

       -writable
              Matches files which are writable by the current user.  This takes into account access control lists and other permissions artefacts which the -perm test
              ignores.   This  test  makes  use of the access(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many
              systems implement access(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held on the server.

       -xtype c
              The same as -type unless the file is a symbolic link.  For symbolic links: if the -H or -P option was specified, true if the file is a link to a file of
              type c; if the -L option has been given, true if c is `l'.  In other words, for symbolic links, -xtype checks the type of the file that -type  does  not
              check.

       -context pattern
              (SELinux only) Security context of the file matches glob pattern.

   ACTIONS
       -delete
              Delete  files or directories; true if removal succeeded.  If the removal failed, an error message is issued and find's exit status will be nonzero (when
              it eventually exits).

              Warning: Don't forget that find evaluates the command line as an expression, so putting -delete first will make find try to delete everything below  the
              starting points you specified.

              The use of the -delete action on the command line automatically turns on the -depth option.  As in turn -depth makes -prune ineffective, the -delete ac‐
              tion cannot usefully be combined with -prune.

              Often,  the user might want to test a find command line with -print prior to adding -delete for the actual removal run.  To avoid surprising results, it
              is usually best to remember to use -depth explicitly during those earlier test runs.

              The -delete action will fail to remove a directory unless it is empty.

              Together with the -ignore_readdir_race option, find will ignore errors of the -delete action in the case the file has disappeared since the  parent  di‐
              rectory was read: it will not output an error diagnostic, not change the exit code to nonzero, and the return code of the -delete action will be true.

       -exec command ;
              Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until an argument consisting of
              `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just
              in  arguments  where  it  is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect
              them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES section for examples of the use of the -exec option.  The specified command is  run  once  for  each
              matched  file.   The  command  is  executed in the starting directory.  There are unavoidable security problems surrounding use of the -exec action; you
              should use the -execdir option instead.

       -exec command {} +
              This variant of the -exec action runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command line is built by appending each selected file name at
              the end; the total number of invocations of the command will be much less than the number of matched files.  The command line is built in much the  same
              way that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the command, and it must appear at the end, immediately before the
              `+';  it  needs to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect it from interpretation by the shell.  The command is executed in the starting directory.
              If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then find returns a non-zero exit status.  If  find  encounters  an  error,
              this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run at all.  For this reason -exec my-command ... {} + -quit may not re‐
              sult in my-command actually being run.  This variant of -exec always returns true.

       -execdir command ;

       -execdir command {} +
              Like -exec, but the specified command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file, which is not normally the directory in which you started
              find.  As with -exec, the {} should be quoted if find is being invoked from a shell.  This a much more secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids
              race  conditions  during  resolution of the paths to the matched files.  As with the -exec action, the `+' form of -execdir will build a command line to
              process more than one matched file, but any given invocation of command will only list files that exist in the same subdirectory.  If you use  this  op‐
              tion,  you  must  ensure that your PATH environment variable does not reference `.'; otherwise, an attacker can run any commands they like by leaving an
              appropriately-named file in a directory in which you will run -execdir.  The same applies to having entries in PATH which are empty or which are not ab‐
              solute directory names.  If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then find returns a non-zero exit status.  If find
              encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run at all.  The result of the  action  depends  on
              whether  the  +  or the ; variant is being used; -execdir command {} + always returns true, while -execdir command {} ; returns true only if command re‐
              turns 0.

       -fls file
              True; like -ls but write to file like -fprint.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See  the  UNUSUAL  FILENAMES
              section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprint file
              True;  print  the  full  file name into file file.  If file does not exist when find is run, it is created; if it does exist, it is truncated.  The file
              names /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr are handled specially; they refer to the standard output and standard error output, respectively.  The output file  is
              always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are
              handled.

       -fprint0 file
              True;  like  -print0  but write to file like -fprint.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the UNUSUAL FILE‐
              NAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprintf file format
              True; like -printf but write to file like -fprint.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See  the  UNUSUAL  FILE‐
              NAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -ls    True;  list current file in ls -dils format on standard output.  The block counts are of 1 KB blocks, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
              set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -ok command ;
              Like -exec but ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run the command.  Otherwise just return false.  If the command is run,  its  standard  input  is
              redirected from /dev/null.  This action may not be specified together with the -files0-from option.

              The response to the prompt is matched against a pair of regular expressions to determine if it is an affirmative or negative response.  This regular ex‐
              pression  is  obtained from the system if the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, or otherwise from find's message translations.  If the system
              has no suitable definition, find's own definition will be used.  In either case, the interpretation of the regular expression itself will be affected by
              the environment variables LC_CTYPE (character classes) and LC_COLLATE (character ranges and equivalence classes).

       -okdir command ;
              Like -execdir but ask the user first in the same way as for -ok.  If the user does not agree, just return false.  If the command is  run,  its  standard
              input is redirected from /dev/null.  This action may not be specified together with the -files0-from option.

       -print True;  print  the  full file name on the standard output, followed by a newline.  If you are piping the output of find into another program and there is
              the faintest possibility that the files which you are searching for might contain a newline, then you should seriously consider using the -print0 option
              instead of -print.  See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -print0
              True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the newline character that -print  uses).   This  allows
              file names that contain newlines or other types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the find output.  This option corre‐
              sponds to the -0 option of xargs.

       -printf format
              True;  print  format  on  the  standard  output,  interpreting `\' escapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and precisions can be specified as with the
              printf(3) C function.  Please note that many of the fields are printed as %s rather than %d, and this may mean that flags don't work as  you  might  ex‐
              pect.   This  also means that the `-' flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned).  Unlike -print, -printf does not add a newline at the end of
              the string.  The escapes and directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush the output.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \0     ASCII NUL.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

              A `\' character followed by any other character is treated as an ordinary character, so they both are printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's last access time in the format returned by the C ctime(3) function.

              %Ak    File's last access time in the format specified by k, which is either `@' or a directive for the C strftime(3) function.  The following shows  an
                     incomplete list of possible values for k.  Please refer to the documentation of strftime(3) for the full list.  Some of the conversion specifica‐
                     tion characters might not be available on all systems, due to differences in the implementation of the strftime(3) library function.

                            (which may be affected by setting the TZ environment variable).  The seconds field includes a fractional part.

                            format, there is no fractional part in the seconds field.

              %b     The amount of disk space used for this file in 512-byte blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block size this  is
                     usually greater than %s/512, but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %Bk    File's  birth  time, i.e., its creation time, in the format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.  This directive produces an empty string
                     if the underlying operating system or filesystem does not support birth times.

              %c     File's last status change time in the format returned by the C ctime(3) function.

              %Ck    File's last status change time in the format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.

              %d     File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file is a starting-point.

              %D     The device number on which the file exists (the st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.

              %f     Print the basename; the file's name with any leading directories removed (only the last element).  For /, the result is `/'.   See  the  EXAMPLES
                     section for an example.

              %F     Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can be used for -fstype.

              %g     File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.

              %G     File's numeric group ID.

              %h     Dirname; the Leading directories of the file's name (all but the last element).  If the file name contains no slashes (since it is in the current
                     directory)  the  %h  specifier  expands  to `.'.  For files which are themselves directories and contain a slash (including /), %h expands to the
                     empty string.  See the EXAMPLES section for an example.

              %H     Starting-point under which file was found.

              %i     File's inode number (in decimal).

              %k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1 KB blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in multiples of the filesystem block size this is usu‐
                     ally greater than %s/1024, but it can also be smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not a symbolic link).

              %m     File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses the `traditional' numbers which most Unix implementations use, but if your particular imple‐
                     mentation uses an unusual ordering of octal permissions bits, you will see a difference between the actual value of the file's mode and the  out‐
                     put of %m.  Normally you will want to have a leading zero on this number, and to do this, you should use the # flag (as in, for example, `%#m').

              %M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for ls).  This directive is supported in findutils 4.2.5 and later.

              %n     Number of hard links to file.

              %p     File's name.

              %P     File's name with the name of the starting-point under which it was found removed.

              %s     File's size in bytes.

              %S     File's sparseness.  This is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value you will get for an ordinary file of a certain length
                     is  system-dependent.   However, normally sparse files will have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect blocks may have a value which
                     is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of blocks used by a file is file system dependent.  The value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent,
                     but is usually 512 bytes.  If the file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.  On systems which  lack  support  for  st_blocks,  a  file's
                     sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.

              %t     File's last modification time in the format returned by the C ctime(3) function.

              %Tk    File's last modification time in the format specified by k, which is the same as for %A.

              %u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name.

              %U     File's numeric user ID.

              %y     File's type (like in ls -l), U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)

              %Y     File's  type (like %y), plus follow symbolic links: `L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?' for any other error when determining the type of the target of
                     a symbolic link.

              %Z     (SELinux only) file's security context.

              %{ %[ %(
                     Reserved for future use.

              A `%' character followed by any other character is discarded, but the other character is printed (don't rely on this, as further format  characters  may
              be introduced).  A `%' at the end of the format argument causes undefined behaviour since there is no following character.  In some locales, it may hide
              your door keys, while in others it may remove the final page from the novel you are reading.

              The %m and %d directives support the #, 0 and + flags, but the other directives do not, even if they print numbers.  Numeric directives that do not sup‐
              port  these flags include G, U, b, D, k and n.  The `-' format flag is supported and changes the alignment of a field from right-justified (which is the
              default) to left-justified.

              See the UNUSUAL FILENAMES section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -prune True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.  If -depth is given, then -prune has no effect.  Because -delete implies  -depth,  you  cannot
              usefully  use  -prune and -delete together.  For example, to skip the directory src/emacs and all files and directories under it, and print the names of
              the other files found, do something like this:
                  find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print

       -quit  Exit immediately (with return value zero if no errors have occurred).  This is different to -prune because -prune only applies to the contents of pruned
              directories, while -quit simply makes find stop immediately.  No child processes will be left running.  Any command  lines  which  have  been  built  by
              -exec ... +  or  -execdir ... +  are invoked before the program is exited.  After -quit is executed, no more files specified on the command line will be
              processed.  For example, `find /tmp/foo /tmp/bar -print -quit` will print only `/tmp/foo`.
              One common use of -quit is to stop searching the file system once we have found what we want.  For example, if we want to find just a single file we can
              do this:
                  find / -name needle -print -quit

   OPERATORS
       Listed in order of decreasing precedence:

       ( expr )
              Force precedence.  Since parentheses are special to the shell, you will normally need to quote them.  Many of the examples in this manual page use back‐
              slashes for this purpose: `\(...\)' instead of `(...)'.

       ! expr True if expr is false.  This character will also usually need protection from interpretation by the shell.

       -not expr
              Same as ! expr, but not POSIX compliant.

       expr1 expr2
              Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an implied -a; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false.

       expr1 -a expr2
              Same as expr1 expr2.

       expr1 -and expr2
              Same as expr1 expr2, but not POSIX compliant.

       expr1 -o expr2
              Or; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is true.

       expr1 -or expr2
              Same as expr1 -o expr2, but not POSIX compliant.

       expr1 , expr2
              List; both expr1 and expr2 are always evaluated.  The value of expr1 is discarded; the value of the list is the value of expr2.  The comma operator  can
              be  useful  for  searching  for several different types of thing, but traversing the filesystem hierarchy only once.  The -fprintf action can be used to
              list the various matched items into several different output files.

       Please note that -a when specified implicitly (for example by two tests appearing without an explicit operator between them) or explicitly  has  higher  prece‐
       dence than -o.  This means that find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print will never print afile.

UNUSUAL FILENAMES
       Many  of the actions of find result in the printing of data which is under the control of other users.  This includes file names, sizes, modification times and
       so forth.  File names are a potential problem since they can contain any character except `\0' and `/'.  Unusual characters in file names can do unexpected and
       often undesirable things to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your function keys on some terminals).  Unusual characters are handled differ‐
       ently by various actions, as described below.

       -print0, -fprint0
              Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal.

       -ls, -fls
              Unusual characters are always escaped.  White space, backslash, and double quote characters are printed using C-style escaping (for example `\f', `\"').
              Other unusual characters are printed using an octal escape.  Other printable characters (for -ls and -fls these are the characters between octal 041 and
              0176) are printed as-is.

       -printf, -fprintf
              If the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is.  Otherwise, the result depends on which directive is in use.  The directives %D, %F,  %g,
              %G,  %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are not under control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m,
              %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have values which are under the control of files' owners but which cannot be used to send arbitrary data to the terminal,  and
              so these are printed as-is.  The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are quoted.  This quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU ls.  This is not the
              same quoting mechanism as the one used for -ls and -fls.  If you are able to decide what format to use for the output of find then it is normally better
              to  use `\0' as a terminator than to use newline, as file names can contain white space and newline characters.  The setting of the LC_CTYPE environment
              variable is used to determine which characters need to be quoted.

       -print, -fprint
              Quoting is handled in the same way as for -printf and -fprintf.  If you are using find in a script or in a situation where the matched files might  have
              arbitrary names, you should consider using -print0 instead of -print.

       The -ok and -okdir actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.

STANDARDS CONFORMANCE
       For  closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.  The following options are specified in the POSIX stan‐
       dard (IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition):

       -H     This option is supported.

       -L     This option is supported.

       -name  This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX conformance of the system's fnmatch(3) library function.   As  of  findutils-4.2.2,
              shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) match a leading `.', because IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.  This is a change from pre‐
              vious versions of findutils.

       -type  Supported.   POSIX  specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f' and `s'.  GNU find also supports `D', representing a Door, where the OS provides these.  Fur‐
              thermore, GNU find allows multiple types to be specified at once in a comma-separated list.

       -ok    Supported.  Interpretation of the response is according to the `yes' and `no' patterns selected by setting the LC_MESSAGES environment  variable.   When
              the  POSIXLY_CORRECT  environment  variable is set, these patterns are taken system's definition of a positive (yes) or negative (no) response.  See the
              system's documentation for nl_langinfo(3), in particular YESEXPR and NOEXPR.  When POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set,  the  patterns  are  instead  taken  from
              find's own message catalogue.

       -newer Supported.  If the file specified is a symbolic link, it is always dereferenced.  This is a change from previous behaviour, which used to take the rele‐
              vant time from the symbolic link; see the HISTORY section below.

       -perm  Supported.   If  the  POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is not set, some mode arguments (for example +a+x) which are not valid in POSIX are supported
              for backward-compatibility.

       Other primaries
              The primaries -atime, -ctime, -depth, -exec, -group, -links, -mtime, -nogroup, -nouser, -ok, -path, -print, -prune, -size, -user and -xdev are all  sup‐
              ported.

       The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the logical AND/OR operators -a and -o.

       All  other  options,  predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of these extensions are not unique to GNU find, how‐
       ever.

       The POSIX standard requires that find detects loops:

              The find utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file  encountered.   When
              it  detects  an  infinite loop, find shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or termi‐
              nate.

       GNU find complies with these requirements.  The link count of directories which contain entries which are hard links to an ancestor will often  be  lower  than
       they  otherwise  should  be.   This can mean that GNU find will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.
       Since find does not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a diagnostic message.  Although this behaviour may be somewhat  confus‐
       ing,  it  is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this behaviour.  If the leaf optimisation has been turned off with -noleaf, the directory entry will al‐
       ways be examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is appropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used to create filesystem cycles as such, but  if
       the  -L  option  or  the -follow option is in use, a diagnostic message is issued when find encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with loops containing hard
       links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that find knows that it doesn't need to call stat() or chdir() on the symbolic link, so this  diagnostic  is  fre‐
       quently not necessary.

       The -d option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems, but you should use the POSIX-compliant option -depth instead.

       The  POSIXLY_CORRECT  environment variable does not affect the behaviour of the -regex or -iregex tests because those tests aren't specified in the POSIX stan‐
       dard.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LANG   Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null.

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_COLLATE
              The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the pattern matching to be used for the -name option.  GNU  find  uses  the  fnmatch(3)  library
              function,  and so support for LC_COLLATE depends on the system library.  This variable also affects the interpretation of the response to -ok; while the
              LC_MESSAGES variable selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to -ok, the interpretation of any bracket expressions in the pattern will
              be affected by LC_COLLATE.

       LC_CTYPE
              This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in regular expressions and also with the -name test, if the  system's  fnmatch(3)  library
              function  supports  this.   This  variable also affects the interpretation of any character classes in the regular expressions used to interpret the re‐
              sponse to the prompt issued by -ok.  The LC_CTYPE environment variable will also affect which characters are considered to be unprintable when filenames
              are printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determines the locale to be used for internationalised messages.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, this also determines the interpre‐
              tation of the response to the prompt made by the -ok action.

       NLSPATH
              Determines the location of the internationalisation message catalogues.

       PATH   Affects the directories which are searched to find the executables invoked by -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              Determines the block size used by -ls and -fls.  If POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, blocks are units of 512 bytes.  Otherwise they are units of 1024 bytes.

              Setting this variable also turns off warning messages (that is, implies -nowarn) by default, because POSIX requires that apart from the output for  -ok,
              all messages printed on stderr are diagnostics and must result in a non-zero exit status.

              When  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  not  set, -perm +zzz is treated just like -perm /zzz if +zzz is not a valid symbolic mode.  When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, such
              constructs are treated as an error.

              When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, the response to the prompt made by the -ok action is interpreted according to the system's message catalogue, as opposed to
              according to find's own message translations.

       TZ     Affects the time zone used for some of the time-related format directives of -printf and -fprintf.

EXAMPLES
   Simple `find|xargs` approach
       •      Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them.

                  $ find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f

              Note that this will work incorrectly if there are any filenames containing newlines, single or double quotes, or spaces.

   Safer `find -print0 | xargs -0` approach
       •      Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them, processing filenames in such a way that file or directory names containing  single
              or double quotes, spaces or newlines are correctly handled.

                  $ find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f

              The -name test comes before the -type test in order to avoid having to call stat(2) on every file.

       Note that there is still a race between the time find traverses the hierarchy printing the matching filenames, and the time the process executed by xargs works
       with that file.

   Processing arbitrary starting points
       •      Given  that  another  program proggy pre-filters and creates a huge NUL-separated list of files, process those as starting points, and find all regular,
              empty files among them:

                  $ proggy | find -files0-from - -maxdepth 0 -type f -empty

              The use of `-files0-from -` means to read the names of the starting points from standard input, i.e., from the pipe; and -maxdepth 0 ensures  that  only
              explicitly those entries are examined without recursing into directories (in the case one of the starting points is one).

   Executing a command for each file
       •      Run file on every file in or below the current directory.

                  $ find . -type f -exec file '{}' \;

              Notice  that  the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation.  The semicolon is similarly
              protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes could have been used in that case also.

       In many cases, one might prefer the `-exec ... +` or better the `-execdir ... +` syntax for performance and security reasons.

   Traversing the filesystem just once - for 2 different actions
       •      Traverse the filesystem just once, listing set-user-ID files and directories into /root/suid.txt and large files into /root/big.txt.

                  $ find / \
                      \( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt '%#m %u %p\n' \) , \
                      \( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt '%-10s %p\n' \)

              This example uses the line-continuation character '\' on the first two lines to instruct the shell to continue reading the command on the next line.

   Searching files by age
       •      Search for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours.

                  $ find $HOME -mtime 0

              This command works this way because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any remainder is discarded.  That  means  that
              to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a modification in the past which is less than 24 hours ago.

   Searching files by permissions
       •      Search for files which are executable but not readable.

                  $ find /sbin /usr/sbin -executable \! -readable -print

       •      Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner, and group, but which other users can read but not write to.

                  $ find . -perm 664

              Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example if someone can execute the file) will not be matched.

       •      Search  for  files which have read and write permission for their owner and group, and which other users can read, without regard to the presence of any
              extra permission bits (for example the executable bit).

                  $ find . -perm -664

              This will match a file which has mode 0777, for example.

       •      Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).

                  $ find . -perm /222

       •      Search for files which are writable by either their owner or their group.

                  $ find . -perm /220
                  $ find . -perm /u+w,g+w
                  $ find . -perm /u=w,g=w

              All three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses the octal representation of the file mode, and the  other  two  use  the  symbolic
              form.  The files don't have to be writable by both the owner and group to be matched; either will do.

       •      Search for files which are writable by both their owner and their group.

                  $ find . -perm -220
                  $ find . -perm -g+w,u+w

              Both these commands do the same thing.

       •      A more elaborate search on permissions.

                  $ find . -perm -444 -perm /222 \! -perm /111
                  $ find . -perm -a+r -perm /a+w \! -perm /a+x

              These  two  commands  both  search  for files that are readable for everybody (-perm -444 or -perm -a+r), have at least one write bit set (-perm /222 or
              -perm /a+w) but are not executable for anybody (! -perm /111 or ! -perm /a+x respectively).

   Pruning - omitting files and subdirectories
       •      Copy the contents of /source-dir to /dest-dir, but omit files and directories named .snapshot (and anything in them).  It also omits files  or  directo‐
              ries whose name ends in `~', but not their contents.

                  $ cd /source-dir
                  $ find . -name .snapshot -prune -o \( \! -name '*~' -print0 \) \
                      | cpio -pmd0 /dest-dir

              The  construct  -prune -o \( ... -print0 \)  is quite common.  The idea here is that the expression before -prune matches things which are to be pruned.
              However, the -prune action itself returns true, so the following -o ensures that the right hand side is  evaluated  only  for  those  directories  which
              didn't  get  pruned  (the  contents of the pruned directories are not even visited, so their contents are irrelevant).  The expression on the right hand
              side of the -o is in parentheses only for clarity.  It emphasises that the -print0 action takes place only for things that didn't have -prune applied to
              them.  Because the default `and' condition between tests binds more tightly than -o, this is the default anyway, but the parentheses help to  show  what
              is going on.

       •      Given the following directory of projects and their associated SCM administrative directories, perform an efficient search for the projects' roots:

                  $ find repo/ \
                      \( -exec test -d '{}/.svn' \; \
                      -or -exec test -d '{}/.git' \; \
                      -or -exec test -d '{}/CVS' \; \
                      \) -print -prune

              Sample output:

                  repo/project1/CVS
                  repo/gnu/project2/.svn
                  repo/gnu/project3/.svn
                  repo/gnu/project3/src/.svn
                  repo/project4/.git

              In  this  example, -prune prevents unnecessary descent into directories that have already been discovered (for example we do not search project3/src be‐
              cause we already found project3/.svn), but ensures sibling directories (project2 and project3) are found.

   Other useful examples
       •      Search for several file types.

                  $ find /tmp -type f,d,l

              Search for files, directories, and symbolic links in the directory /tmp passing these types as a comma-separated list (GNU extension), which  is  other‐
              wise equivalent to the longer, yet more portable:

       •      Search for files with the particular name needle and stop immediately when we find the first one.

                  $ find / -name needle -print -quit

       •      Demonstrate  the  interpretation of the %f and %h format directives of the -printf action for some corner-cases.  Here is an example including some out‐
              put.

                  $ find . .. / /tmp /tmp/TRACE compile compile/64/tests/find -maxdepth 0 -printf '[%h][%f]\n'

EXIT STATUS
       find exits with status 0 if all files are processed successfully, greater than 0 if errors occur.  This is deliberately a very broad description,  but  if  the
       return value is non-zero, you should not rely on the correctness of the results of find.

       When  some error occurs, find may stop immediately, without completing all the actions specified.  For example, some starting points may not have been examined
       or some pending program invocations for -exec ... {} + or -execdir ... {} + may not have been performed.

HISTORY
       As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) used in filename patterns match a leading `.', because IEEE POSIX interpretation 126
       requires this.

       As of findutils-4.3.3, -perm /000 now matches all files instead of none.

       Nanosecond-resolution timestamps were implemented in findutils-4.3.3.

       As of findutils-4.3.11, the -delete action sets find's exit status to a nonzero value when it fails.  However, find will  not  exit  immediately.   Previously,
       find's exit status was unaffected by the failure of -delete.

       The  syntax  -perm  +MODE was removed in findutils-4.5.12, in favour of -perm /MODE.  The +MODE syntax had been deprecated since findutils-4.2.21 which was re‐
       leased in 2005.

NON-BUGS
   Operator precedence surprises
       The command find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print will never print afile because this is actually equivalent to find . -name afile  -o  \(  -name  bfile  -a
       -print \).  Remember that the precedence of -a is higher than that of -o and when there is no operator specified between tests, -a is assumed.

   “paths must precede expression” error message
       $ find . -name *.c -print
       find: paths must precede expression
       find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?

       This  happens when the shell could expand the pattern *.c to more than one file name existing in the current directory, and passing the resulting file names in
       the command line to find like this:
       find . -name frcode.c locate.c word_io.c -print
       That command is of course not going to work, because the -name predicate allows exactly only one pattern as argument.  Instead of doing things  this  way,  you
       should  enclose  the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard, thus allowing find to use the pattern with the wildcard during the search for file name matching
       instead of file names expanded by the parent shell:
       $ find . -name '*.c' -print
       $ find . -name \*.c -print

BUGS
       There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard specifies for find, which therefore cannot be fixed.  For example, the -exec  ac‐
       tion is inherently insecure, and -execdir should be used instead.

       The environment variable LC_COLLATE has no effect on the -ok action.
